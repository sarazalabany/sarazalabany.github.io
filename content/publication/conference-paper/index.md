abstract: Capacitive touch screens (CTS’s) are essential components in most of today’s digital devices. However, for the visually impaired (VI) users due
  to the uneven topography of the tactile surface, CTS’s are more challenging to implement and thus this ﬁeld remains largely underdeveloped. Considering
  the limited space around the microactuators driving the typical Braille dots for a tactile screen with ten dots-per-inch (dpi) resolution, the materials used
  for CTS should be ﬂexible and durable with high mechanical strength. In this work, a ﬂexible CTS based on polyimide (PI) and silver nanowires (AgNWs)
  as electrodes with a total thickness of 210 μm is developed. The dimensions of the AgNWs are on average 7.9 ± 2.4 μm in length and 85 ± 24 nm in width. 
  The AgNWs electrodes showed low resistance and good adhesion to the PI substrate. A gesture recognition application is collected from the capacitive
  data to classify diﬀerent gestures (including single- and double-click, swipe-left and -right, scroll-up and -down as well as zoom-in and -out) with two
  diﬀerent approaches; machine learning and deep learning are implemented. The best performance is obtained using the YOLO model with a high
  validation accuracy of 97.76%. Finally, a software application is developed with the proposed hand gestures in real-time to foster interaction of VI users
  with the tactile display allowing them to navigate a Windows ﬁle system and interact with the documents via hand gestures in a similar manner as sighted
  users on a conventional touch display will be able to do. This work paves the way to utilize CTS for the tactile displays in the market developed for VI users.
